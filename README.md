Data assimilation in a single column sea ice model.


The objective of this repository is to enable a user to either:
    - replicate the results of Wieringa et al. (2023) OR
    - launch their own single-column sea ice data assimilation experiments.

To take advantage of the tools included in this repository, the user will also need working installations of the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) (Anderson et al.,2009), available <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/NCAR/DART">here</a> and the single column sea ice model, Icepack available <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/CICE-Consortium/Icepack">here</a>.
